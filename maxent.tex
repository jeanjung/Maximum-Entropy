\section{Representation Dependence}

\subsection{Representation Dependence in Probabilistic Inference \cite{HalpernK04}}

The article \cite{HalpernK04} considers the notion of ``representation dependence'' which
is a very common notion in non-deductive (inductive) reasoning systems: The results of an
inference procedure depend heavily of the chosen representation formalism, \mbox{i.e.}, the
way the knowledge is written down. In particular representation dependence is one of the
major points of criticism of the principle of maximum entropy.
